Factors votes and formula calculation:
for each project member there will be a special factor for consistency properties with factor if -1
its value will indicate successful or failed voting process
    -1 will mean failed or incomplete voting
    -2 will mean valid vote
meaning:
    -> when uploading from the system if for certain project member the -1 factor is -1 an indicating msg should be
        sent to the member and the persisted vote should be deleted
    -> when calculating the formula (kept as a list of values without their ids/names) we should not consider negative
        values!
